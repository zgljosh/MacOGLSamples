Already familiar with OpenGL 4+ theory and unable to run sample codes on your Mac?
Here is a collection of OpenGL 4.1 code projects running on MAC OS X mavericks.

For now, most of sample codes are based on OpenGL SuperBible 6th edition and I have tested it on my iMac.
(Original codes only support VS2010 so I ported to Mac OS X)
But I'll keep adding more projects showing interesting modern Open GL features on iMac. Purpose is to 
make it easier to learn/practice OpenGL on Mac OS. See my blog on why creating this repo:
